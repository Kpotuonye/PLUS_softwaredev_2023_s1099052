'''Another quote from the recommended book:
“We can’t read water in the same way as we can’t read data…Working with it makes us more aware of the distance between ourselves and the matter under consideration: it reminds us that we share this world rather than own it. Knowledge produced through the medium of the shifting surface of a bucket of water is made in cooperation with the world, rather than by conquering it.”
― James Bridle, Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence
